    <![endif]--><div>Open Data: What is it anyway?</div><div>It's simple really.</div><div>"A piece of data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it â€” subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and/or share-alike."</div><div>Data in government usually means tabular data: CSVs, Excel Spreadsheets, tables embedded in PDFs. Which could be budget reports, library circulation data, etc.</div><div>But also things like maps and map features: Shapefiles and the like. Could include locations of fire hydrants, bicycle parking locations, city boundaries.</div><div>Now that we know what open data means...</div><div>why does open data matter in the government context?</div><div>An Example</div><div>Giving access to data can improve the delivery of public service.</div><div>In Uganda, service delivery is stifled by corruption and inefficiency.</div><div>So the government decided to try an experiment: publish information on monthly transfers of grants to a set of randomly selected schools.</div><div><a target=_blank href=http://people.su.se/~jsven/PInformation2010.pdf>What they found was that by providing this access to the public (mainly teachers and parents) more of these funds actually went to the schools</a></div><div>Another Example</div><div>Giving access to information that allows the public to assess politician accountability allows the public to elect better policy makers.</div><div>In 2003, Brazil randomly selected municipalities to audit their spending of federally transferred funds. They made this information public.</div><div><a target=_blank href=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~ffinan/Finan_Audit.pdf>Doing this reduced the likelihood of re-election of officials by up to 17% when at least two violations associated with corruption were reported in the audited municipalities</a></div><div>So making data available to the public is beneficial!</div><div>On June 1st, Mayor Berke signed an executive order establishing a city open data policy: <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/cityofchattanooga/Executive-Orders>https://github.com/cityofchattanooga/Executive-Orders</a></div><div>And a data portal!: <a target=_blank href=http://data.chattlibrary.org>http://data.chattlibrary.org</a></div><div>So how can you actually participate?</div><div>Suggest a dataset: <a target=_blank href=https://data.chattlibrary.org/nominate>https://data.chattlibrary.org/nominate</a></div><div>Get involved with Open Chattanooga!: <a target=_blank href=http://openchattanooga.com>http://openchattanooga.com</a></div><div><img src=/images/e908e109.openchattanooga.png></div><div>Also, check out our GitHub organization. Feel free to contribute to a project! openchattanooga.com is a GitHub page!: <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/openchattanooga>https://github.com/openchattanooga</a></div><div><a target=_blank href=https://trello.com/b/D4TsoBsT/knight-foundation-open-chattanooga>Watch the Trello board</a></div><div><img src=/images/16d4b037.trello.png></div><div><a target=_blank href=https://github.com/openchattanooga/project-ideas/issues>Propose a project on Open Chattanooga's project ideas</a></div><div><img src=/images/bde78fcb.projectideas.png></div><div>You don't have to tie the project in directly with a dataset, but if it happens to need one and doesn't already exist, we'll try to make it happen.</div><div>Do something cool with a dataset from the portal and show it off!</div><div><a target=_blank href=http://projects.timesfreepress.com/2014/07/commute/index.html>For instance, a visualization.</a></div><div><img src=/images/deaefbc5.meantraveltimetowork.png></div><div><a target=_blank href="http://openchattanooga.com/chattanooga-bike-parking-locator/">An application that uses open data.</a></div><div><img src=/images/63e2c975.chattbikeparking.png></div><div>Using data from the portal for visualizations and apps is pretty simple.</div><div>The data portal supports CORS! So you can do this..</div><div><img src=/images/15ccf9dd.code.png></div><div>More about querying the data through each dataset API can be found here: <a target=_blank href=http://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries.html>http://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries.html</a></div><div>Each dataset API is self documented. For example, the bicycle parking data API: <a target=_blank href=https://data.chattlibrary.org/developers/docs/bicycle-parking-locations-in-the-city-of-chattanooga>https://data.chattlibrary.org/developers/docs/bicycle-parking-locations-in-the-city-of-chattanooga</a></div><div><img src=/images/ca3cb09b.api.png></div><div>If there is a dataset without an API that you'd like to use, let me know!</div><div>Thanks for listening!
